        <p>If players play cards of the same value, then there is a war. Players will place three of their cards faced down on the table and draw again. The winner of the war takes both pairs of played cards and the three cards faced down, winning five of their opponentâ€™s cards.The player who wins all of the cards, wins the game.</p>
