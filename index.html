        <p>At the game's start the deck is divided evenly between the two players.Both players place the top card of their deck onto the center of the table. The player whose card is higher in value takes both cards and places them in a separate pile next to their deck.</p>
        <p>If players play cards of the same value, then there is a war. Players will place three of their cards faced down on the table and draw again. The winner of the war takes both pairs of played cards and the three cards faced down, winning five of their opponentâ€™s cards.The player who wins all of the cards, wins the game.</p>
