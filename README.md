THEY THEN GO HEAD TO HEAD PLACING ONE CARD AT A TIME FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE DECKS, WITH THE HIGHEST CARD WINNING THE MATCH. THE WINNER TAKES BOTH CARDS INTO HIS DECK AND PLAY CONTINUES FOR 26 ROUNDS. THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST CARDS IN THEIR HAND AT THE END WINS!

THE GAME WAR HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AN UNTOLD AMOUNT OF TIME AND LOVED BY YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.
